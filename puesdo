Before beginning this program create a process of how you will complete it!

Whats step will you take and what order will you go in to make it work.

MVC = Model(database/Mysql).......View(Client/handlebars)........Controller(pathways/express)

The controller is used to tell the Model and view what to do by using pathways.

The modal controls all databases  by using mysql aswell as the ORM which stands for OBJECT RELATIONAL Mapping.

We will use ORM as basicly a map so the we can use mysql more effeintly.

Create logic for the ORM using data base mysql as your guide
